### React State Management & Component Communication

Completed:
- Built a Keeper (Notes) App using React
- Managed a list of notes using `useState`
- Added new notes dynamically through controlled inputs
- Passed data between components using props
- Implemented delete functionality using note IDs
- Used `map()` to render multiple components
- Practiced immutable state updates

Key Takeaway:
Managing arrays in React state requires immutable updates. Lifting state up and passing handler functions through props allows components to communicate effectively and keep the UI in sync.
